# Roman Numerals Kata 

ü§î What is a kata?

ü•ãA Kata in martial arts means ‚Äúa system of individual training exercises‚Äù. Just like in martial arts, coding also requires consistent practise to hone in the skill.

üóíÔ∏è Instructions

üëâ Roman Numerals Kata requirements. You can find at [Coding Dojo](https://codingdojo.org/kata/RomanNumerals/).
* Implement your solution in the Java programming language.

## TDD Approach

* Use the Triple A Structure - Arrange, Act, Assert to guide you when writing your unit tests

* Use the RED - GREEN - REFACTOR cycle: Write one failing test first and write the simplest code to make that test pass, then see if there is any opportunity to refactor. If not, move onto writing your next test and follow the cycle through as you build up your solution.

* Remember to consider a range of different test cases and edge cases.

### Solution

In order to guide the RED - GREEN - REFACTOR cycle of the Test Driven Development process the steps, as outlined in The Transformation Priority Premise in [The Clean Code Blog](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html) by Robert C.Martin (Uncle Bob)
were closely followed. The Transformation Priority Premise illustrates the steps to refactor code from specific to generic guided by tests.
However, in the penultimate steps a foreach loop was implemented. Strictly speaking the foreach loop is not included as one of the Transformations in the premise.
